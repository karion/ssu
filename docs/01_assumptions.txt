01 Assumptions

I will ignore system except PointWallet. Logic of gaining points are out of the scope.
All users have PointWallet as 1-1 relation.
I assume some logic will call PointWalletService to add or subtract user points.

There is no logic of subtracting a portion of the Points. All points of one action will be pay out in one moment of time.
